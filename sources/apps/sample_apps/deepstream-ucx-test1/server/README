Prequisites:

Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK, the DeepStream SDK itself and the
apps. In addition, to be able to run the test over an RDMA-enabled network, please
ensure you have also installed the RDMA OFED network stack from here:
https://network.nvidia.com/products/infiniband-drivers/linux/mlnx_ofed/.
MLNX OFED also includes the Unified Communication X framework that is required to
use the Deepstream UCX plugin in gstreamer.

You must have the following development packages installed
   GStreamer-1.0
   GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins
   GStreamer-1.0 gstrtspserver
   X11 client-side library

To install these packages, execute the following command:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev \
   libgstrtspserver-1.0-dev libx11-dev

Compilation Steps:

  $ Set CUDA_VER to 11.7 for x86. The Deepstream UCX plugin does not work in Jetson.
  $ sudo make

To run:
  1. Run the server application first. Required parameters (in order) are the
     IP address of server, Port, Height of frame in video, Width of frame in video,
     URI of video file. For example,

    $  ./deepstream-ucx-test1-server 192.168.100.1 4000 1920 1080 file:////root/image1.mp4

  2. Run the client application next. Required parameters (in order) are the
     IP address of server, Port on server, Height of frame in video, Width of frame in video,
     Location where to save the output file. For example,

    $ ./deepstream-ucx-test1-client 192.168.100.1 4000 1920 1080 /path/to/save/file.mp4

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.

The deepstream-ucx-test1 application is meant for a simple demonstration of how to use
the new communication plugin called nvdsgst_ucx with the Deepstream SDK.

The Deepstream pipeline here consists of the streammux plugin that takes input from the
uridecoder. The streammux passes the frames along with the required metadata to the
nvdsgst_ucx plugin. Here, we show the server side of the plugin that acts as a sink
and sends the data to the client which acts as a source for the remaining pipeline.
The server sends the data to the client using the RDMA network for better performance.
The client forwards the data to the streamdemux plugin, etc. and finally the filesrc
plugin creates the output file.
