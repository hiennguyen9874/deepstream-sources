# RUNTIME SOURCE ADDITION DELETION REFERENCE APP USING DEEPSTREAMSDK 6.0

## Introduction

The project contains Runtime source addition/deletion application to show the
capability of Deepstream SDK.

## Prerequisites:

DeepStream SDK installed which is available at http://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk
Please follow instructions in the apps/sample_apps/deepstream-app/README on how
to install the prequisites for Deepstream SDK apps.

## Getting Started

-   Preferably clone the app in
    `/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/sources/apps/sample_apps/`

-   Edit all the inference models config files according to the location of the models to be used

## Compilation Steps and Execution:

```
  $ Set CUDA_VER in the MakeFile as per platform.
      For Jetson, CUDA_VER=10.2
      For x86, CUDA_VER=11.4
  $ sudo make

  $ ./deepstream-test-rt-src-add-del <uri>
  $ ./deepstream-test-rt-src-add-del file://$DS_SDK_ROOT/samples/streams/sample_1080p_h265.mp4
  $ ./deepstream-test-rt-src-add-del rtsp://127.0.0.1/video
```

The application demonstrates following pipeline for single source <uri>

uridecodebin -> nvstreammux -> nvinfer -> nvtracker -> nvtiler -> nvvideoconvert -> nvdsosd -> displaysink

-   At runtime after a timeout a source will be added periodically. All the components
    are reconfigured during addition/deletion
-   After reaching of `MAX_NUM_SOURCES`, each source is deleted periodically till single
    source is present in the pipeline
-   The app exits, when final source End of Stream is reached or if the last source is deleted.
