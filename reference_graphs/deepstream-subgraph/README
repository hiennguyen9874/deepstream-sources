This sample has a pipeline equal to that in the "deepstream-test1" graph, except
that it uses a subgraph to wrap the core inference part, which is defined in
inference.yaml and can be re-used in different graphs.

The video-in and video-out is the interface exported from the core inference
subgraph, being used as the video input and video output from the parent graph.
So in this example, the video-in of the inference subgraph is connected to the
video out from the single source component in the parent graph and the video-out
is connected to the video renderer component

================================================================================
Pre-requisites
================================================================================
- DeepStreamSDK 6.2
- Graph-Composer 2.5.0

================================================================================
Running the graph
================================================================================
On x86:
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh main_graph.yaml \
       -s inference_subgraph.yaml -d ../common/target_x86_64.yaml

On Jetson:
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh main_graph.yaml \
       -s inference_subgraph.yaml -d ../common/target_aarch64.yaml

NOTE: When executing on a remote target, additional argument "--resources resources.yaml"
      must be provided to execute_graph.sh script.

NOTE: main_graph.yaml is the main graph file describing the DeepStream
graph(pipeline) and it includes the inference_subgraph.yaml using the
"nvidia::gxf::Subgraph" component.

================================================================================
Building application(graph) specific container image
================================================================================
The Graph-Composer Container Builder tool can be used to build application(graph)
specific containers. The container builder configuration files have already been
provided for this sample.

* Building a DGPU container and running on the same host
  $ container_builder -c ds_subgraph_container_builder_dgpu.yaml \
        -d ../common/target_x86_64.yaml
  $ xhost +
  $ docker run -it --rm --gpus all -v /tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix/ \
        -e DISPLAY=:0 deepstream_subgraph_dgpu


* Building a Jetson container on x86 host
- In ds_subgraph_container_builder_jetson.yaml, change <docker-container-registry>
  to a valid docker registry where containers can be pushed, and then build:
  $ container_builder -c ds_subgraph_container_builder_jetson.yaml \
        -d ../common/target_aarch64.yaml

- Push the built image to the docker registry:
  $ docker push <docker-container-registry>:deepstream-subgraph-jetson

* Running the image on Jetson
  $ sudo docker pull <docker-container-registry>:deepstream-subgraph-jetson
  $ xhost +
  $ sudo docker run -it --rm --net=host --runtime nvidia -e DISPLAY=:0 \
        -v /tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix \
        -v /tmp/argus_socket:/tmp/argus_socket \
        <docker-container-registry>:deepstream-subgraph-jetson
